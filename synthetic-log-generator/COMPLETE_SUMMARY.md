## 🔨 What You Need to Complete (10% Remaining)

### Required: 3 Generators (~2-3 hours)

**1. Sentry Generator** (template provided)
```python
# generators/sentry_generator.py
# Pattern: Copy kubernetes_generator.py structure
# Main methods:
- generate_error_event()        # Error with stack trace
- generate_performance_event()  # Transaction data
- generate_breadcrumbs()        # User action trail
# Use realistic_data functions for everything
```

**2. CloudWatch Generator** (similar to K8s metrics)
```python
# generators/cloudwatch_generator.py
# Main methods:
- generate_metric_datapoint()   # CPU, Memory, Network, etc.
- generate_log_entry()          # CloudWatch log streams
- generate_alarm_event()        # Alarm state changes
# Mostly metrics, simpler than K8s
```

**3. Grafana Generator** (simplest one)
```python
# generators/grafana_generator.py
# Main methods:
- generate_panel_query_result() # Time series data
- generate_annotation()         # Dashboard annotations
# Just time series arrays, very straightforward
```

### Required: Orchestrator (~2 hours)

**Main Script** (template provided in IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)
```python
# main.py
# Structure:
1. Parse CLI arguments
2. Load YAML configs
3. Initialize all 4 generators
4. Generate normal operations (use timestamp_utils traffic patterns)
5. Inject incidents (use correlation_engine)
6. Write outputs (compressed JSONL files)
7. Generate correlation metadata (JSON)
```

---

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Complete Generators (1-2 hours each)

**Sentry Generator:**
1. Copy `kubernetes_generator.py` to `sentry_generator.py`
2. Replace K8s schema with Sentry schema
3. Use `realistic_data.generate_stack_trace()` - already done!
4. Use `realistic_data.generate_breadcrumbs()` - already done!
5. Test: `python -c "from generators.sentry_generator import SentryLogGenerator; print('OK')"`

**CloudWatch Generator:**
1. Similar copy pattern from Kubernetes
2. Focus on metrics instead of logs
3. Use simple numeric values with timestamps
4. Test with a few metric types first

**Grafana Generator:**
1. Simplest one - just time series data
2. Array of `[timestamp, value]` pairs
3. Copy panel structure from config
4. Done in < 1 hour

### Phase 2: Create Main Orchestrator (2 hours)

**Simplified Approach:**
```python
# Start with 1-hour generation
# Add normal logs first (no incidents)
# Test output structure
# Then add incident injection
# Use existing correlation_engine methods
```

### Phase 3: Test and Validate (1 hour)

```bash
# Generate test dataset
python main.py --hours 1 --output ./test

# Verify structure
ls -lh test/

# Check logs
zcat test/kubernetes/*.gz | head | jq .

# Count entries
echo "K8s: $(zcat test/kubernetes/*.gz | wc -l)"
```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions Explained

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Modular Generators**: Each source (K8s, Sentry, etc.) is independent
   - Easy to extend
   - Easy to test in isolation
   - Easy to customize

2. **Correlation Engine**: Central orchestration
   - Ensures temporal correlation
   - Manages incident lifecycle
   - Handles cascading failures
   - One source of truth for incident IDs

3. **Realistic Data Utilities**: Separated concerns
   - Reusable across all generators
   - Easy to add new data types
   - Consistent across sources
   - Well-tested patterns

4. **Configuration-Driven**: YAML configs
   - No code changes for new services
   - Easy to add incident types
   - Adjustable parameters
   - Version controllable

### Why These Patterns?

**Traffic Patterns:**
- Based on real production systems
- Peak hours = 9AM-6PM (typical business apps)
- Weekend reduction = 60% (B2B patterns)
- Seasonal spikes = realistic e-commerce patterns

**Incident Patterns:**
- Based on common production incidents
- Memory leaks = gradual degradation (realistic)
- Deployment failures = immediate impact (realistic)
- Database issues = cascading effect (realistic)

**Log Formats:**
- Multiple formats (JSON, logfmt, plain) = realistic diversity
- Structured logging = modern best practices
- Trace IDs = distributed tracing standard
- Stack traces = real error handling patterns
