# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an innovative MCP-orchestrated infrastructure insight engine that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a unified, AI-driven incident detection and response system. The system will build specialized MCP servers for multiple telemetry sources (Kubernetes, Sentry, CloudWatch, Grafana) and orchestrate them through an intelligent coordinator to automate cross-platform incident analysis and remediation.

The primary goal is to reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) by 50-70% through automated correlation of incidents across disparate monitoring platforms, eliminating the manual information gathering that currently consumes 60-80% of incident response time.

## Requirements

2. WHEN requesting cluster events THEN the server SHALL provide events with timestamps, reasons, and affected resources
3. WHEN accessing node metrics THEN the server SHALL return CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization data
4. WHEN filtering by namespace THEN the server SHALL return only resources within the specified namespace
5. IF a pod does not exist THEN the server SHALL return a clear "not found" response

### Requirement 3: Sentry MCP Server

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access Sentry error data through MCP, so that I can correlate application errors with infrastructure events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying for errors THEN the server SHALL return error messages, stack traces, occurrence counts, and metadata
2. WHEN requesting issue details THEN the server SHALL provide full context including user impact and environment data
3. WHEN filtering by time range THEN the server SHALL return only errors within the specified timeframe
4. WHEN accessing error trends THEN the server SHALL provide aggregated statistics and frequency data
5. IF no errors match the criteria THEN the server SHALL return an empty result set with appropriate status

### Requirement 4: CloudWatch MCP Server

**User Story:** As a cloud engineer, I want to query AWS CloudWatch data through MCP, so that I can access logs, metrics, and alarms in a unified format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting log data THEN the server SHALL return log entries with timestamps, log groups, and message content
2. WHEN querying metrics THEN the server SHALL provide metric values, dimensions, and statistical aggregations
3. WHEN accessing alarms THEN the server SHALL return alarm states, thresholds, and trigger conditions
4. WHEN filtering by AWS service THEN the server SHALL return only data from the specified service
5. IF CloudWatch API limits are exceeded THEN the server SHALL implement rate limiting and queue requests

### Requirement 5: Grafana MCP Server

**User Story:** As a monitoring specialist, I want to execute Grafana queries through MCP, so that I can access dashboard data and visualization metrics programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing dashboard queries THEN the server SHALL return time series data with proper formatting
2. WHEN requesting panel data THEN the server SHALL provide metric values, labels, and metadata
3. WHEN accessing annotations THEN the server SHALL return event markers with descriptions and timestamps
4. WHEN querying data sources THEN the server SHALL validate connectivity and return available metrics
5. IF a dashboard does not exist THEN the server SHALL return a descriptive error message

### Requirement 6: Orchestrator MCP Server

**User Story:** As an incident responder, I want an intelligent orchestrator that correlates data across all monitoring sources, so that I can quickly identify root causes and receive remediation suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an incident is detected THEN the orchestrator SHALL query all relevant MCP servers within 10 seconds
2. WHEN correlating cross-source data THEN the orchestrator SHALL identify temporal and semantic relationships
3. WHEN clustering anomalies THEN the orchestrator SHALL achieve >85% silhouette score accuracy
4. WHEN generating remediation suggestions THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide actionable steps with safety controls
5. IF correlation confidence is low THEN the orchestrator SHALL clearly indicate uncertainty levels

### Requirement 7: Zero-Shot Anomaly Clustering

**User Story:** As an SRE, I want the system to automatically cluster similar incidents without prior training data, so that I can identify patterns in previously unseen problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing log entries THEN the system SHALL apply semantic preprocessing with placeholder replacement
2. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use LogBERT or RoBERTa for semantic representation
3. WHEN performing similarity search THEN the system SHALL use FAISS for efficient nearest neighbor queries
4. WHEN clustering anomalies THEN the system SHALL apply HDBSCAN for dynamic cluster formation
5. WHEN labeling clusters THEN the system SHALL use LLM-based analysis to generate descriptive labels

### Requirement 8: Cross-Source Incident Correlation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to automatically correlate incidents across different monitoring platforms, so that I can understand the full scope of problems without manual investigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN incidents occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL identify temporal correlations within configurable time windows
2. WHEN analyzing incident context THEN the system SHALL perform semantic analysis to identify related events
3. WHEN correlating across sources THEN the system SHALL maintain confidence scores for each correlation
4. WHEN presenting correlations THEN the system SHALL provide clear visualization of relationships
5. IF no correlations are found THEN the system SHALL explicitly indicate isolated incidents

### Requirement 9: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP orchestration system to be highly performant and reliable, so that it can handle production workloads without becoming a bottleneck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with up to 100 simultaneous connections
3. WHEN external APIs fail THEN the system SHALL continue operating with degraded functionality
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical incident processing
5. IF system health degrades THEN the system SHALL provide clear monitoring and alerting capabilities

### Requirement 10: Security and Access Control

2. WHEN accessing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls
3. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections (TLS 1.3+)
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails without exposing sensitive information
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access

### Requirement 11: Deployment and Configuration
